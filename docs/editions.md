# Editions

We offer two different SCEPman editions:

### Enterprise Edition \(SCEPman EE\)

SCEPman EE offers all services and all features. If you need enterprise-class features, scalability, and performance, or if you plan to use the software in a production environment that requires support from our highly specialized support and operations team, you should consider the SCEPman Enterprise Edition.

{% hint style="warning" %}
SCEPman EE only is backed by our support services.
{% endhint %}

### Community Edition \(SCEPman CE\)

If you are a tech enthusiast with the ability to self-support, our Community Edition products are freely available and offer powerful capabilities for a non-critical business process or content needs. The only technical difference between SCEPman CE and SCEPman EE is that SCEPman CE **does not support redundancy through Azure Traffic Manager**.



If you want to test SCEPman in your own environment, you can use the [Trial Guide](getting-started/trial-guide.md) and install SCEPman directly into your lab.   
When you later decide to buy SCEPman EE you should follow our [Enterprise Guide](getting-started/enterprise-guide.md) to get a recommended production environment.
